                As a human who has only existed in the age of the computer, I spend a lot of my time on the internet. I have always been curious about how things worked and tried to find different ways to express myself. This led me to dabble in video editing, photography, illustration, and writing.

            <p class="col-xs-auto col-lg-3 col-xl-3 bio-text">
                I wanted to find a way to express all my creative outlets in a single space, so I enrolled in the University of Utah's Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp. As a recent graduate, I am eager to continue building my skills so I may engage with my creativity privately and build a career in web development professionally.
