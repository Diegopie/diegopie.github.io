# My Online Portfolio

I created this website primarily to better understand using Bootstrap. It was a humbling experience and required a lot of reading Bootstrap documentation and experimenting. I plan to continue building on this site to track my educational progress.

## Objective:

- Create a fully functional, sharable application.
- Utilize Bootstrap systems to create a responsive application
- Use a navbar that links to all pages and creates consistency on each page
- Maintain accessibility standards, including using proper semantic HTML
- Express my personality and link to external online profiles

[My Online Portfolio](https://diegopie.github.io/) is hosted on GitHub pages.

## Outcome:

This project taught me the value of pseudo coding as the bedrock of creating an application. I did not start with strong pseudo code and I struggled a lot with making the page appear the way I wanted it too. Another shortcoming I had was making git commits. I tried tackling too much at once and loosing track of my goals and what I was doing with my code. I hope to further polish what is here, if not refactor a lot of it.

## Bugs:
I am still learning! I do not know how to mange the backend, server aspect of this site so the contact me form does not work! If you would like to reach me, please use the link to my Linked In or GitHub accounts.

## Collaborators:

It should not go without saying that none of this is possible without the Bootstrap team.

I would also like to thank Jason Sutliff for reviewing my code and helping me clear some roadblocks to get it where it is now.
