                    As a human who has only existed in the age of the computer, I spend a lot of my time on the internet. As a youngling I was always curious about how things worked and tried to find different ways to express myself. This led me to dabble in video editing, photography, illustration, and writing. I wanted to find a way to express all my creative outlets in a single space, so it was only natural that I would attempt to get a degree in Web Design through the Art Institute.

                <p class="col-xs-auto col-lg-4 index-text">
                    But nothing is ever so simple and I was forced to drop out one week in. While this did allow me to gain valuable skills in the workforce, that curiosity never left and the yearning to create lingered. A coworker showed me a bootcamp hosted by the University of Utah Professional Education department. I figured Destiny 2 could take a break and leapt into bootcamp crucible.

                <p class="col-xs-auto col-lg-4 index-text">
                    This webpage will continue to evolve as my skills do. My hope is for this to be a personal barometer of encouragement to show how far I have come as this bootcamp tries itsâ€™ best to beat me down.
